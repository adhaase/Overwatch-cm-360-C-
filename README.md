# Overwatch cm/360 C++ version
A C++ rendition of my HTML/JS Overwatch cm/360 webapp, utilizing the Qt framework.

Note the current version in this repo is a base implementation without the Qt framework. The Qt version will be up soon!

For now, you can run this application (version 1 just runs in the console) by downloading the executable .exe file in this repository. **Your device may provide a warning upon trying to open the executable. Don't worry, the file is safe to open!**

### The initial UI looks like this:

### The initial FAQ looks like:

### This is just a base implementation and will be revised using the Qt framework to make it pretty :D
### But as for now, it is functional! To be updated soon!
