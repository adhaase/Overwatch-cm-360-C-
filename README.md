# Overwatch App: cm/360Â° converter and sensitivity equalizer (C++ version)
A C++ rendition of my HTML/JS Overwatch cm/360 webapp, utilizing the Qt framework.

## Note the current version in this repo is a base implementation WITHOUT the Qt framework. The Qt version is being worked on!

## Here is the HTML/JS version, the pretty looking one -> :D  https://adhaase.github.io/Overwatch-cm-360/

For now, you can run this application (version 0.1 just runs in the console) by downloading the executable .exe file in this repository. **Your device may provide a warning upon trying to open the executable. Don't worry, the file is safe to open!**

### The initial (console) interface looks like this:

### The initial FAQ looks like:

### This is just a base implementation and will be revised using the Qt framework to make it more appealing! 
### But as for now, it is functional! To be updated soon!
